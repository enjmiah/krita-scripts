krita-scripts
=============

These are a collection of Krita extensions I wrote to fill certain personal
needs.  A short overview of each one is below.


brushsizer
----------

Defines two actions for increasing and decreasing the current brush size in
intelligent increments by taking bigger steps when the brush size is bigger.

Provides:
 - Tools > Scripts > Increase Brush Size (Smart)
 - Tools > Scripts > Decrease Brush Size (Smart)

`actions/brushsizer.action` defines keyboard shortcuts for these two actions.
